I'm Augusto de Paula JÃºlio, software engineer, entrepreneur by nature, tennis player in his spare time, backpacker and also a hobby writer.

The purpose of this blog is to serve as a database of texts that I have already written and will write and group them in a single place on the internet. There will be texts that have already been published on LinkedIn, on other blogs, etc.

The topics will be varied among the things I usually do, study and talk about on a daily basis and will often be timeless. That is, there will be texts on entrepreneurship, programming, travel, financial education, etc.

There will be no defined days for publications, and as I mentioned above, there will be new and old texts.

As I like to travel, get to know new places, different people and cultures and learn new languages, the texts will be / were written in the languages I already have some knowledge or I am learning.

That's it! Let's go!
