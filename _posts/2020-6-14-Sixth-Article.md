title: The power of Python programming language
---

Hi folks! Here it's an english article that I wrote in the beginning of this (2020) talking about some benefits of Python programming language. Enjoy it!

A few days ago I was chatting with co-workers about web and mobile technologies and we got into an interesting subject: I want to enter the IT field as a programmer and I don’t know which programming language to choose to start with.

Which would you choose?

The answer to this question is obviously not binary, but discussing some points, I would like to share my personal conclusions on this topic.

It’s worth remembering that my initial background was with HTML, CSS, JS (very little at the beginning) and then I migrated to the backend development where I already worked with NodeJS, a little bit of Java, PHP and now Python.

My choice (for the year 2020) is Python. Due to some factors:

FAST LEARNING

- Simple syntax and very similar to English

- Many tutorials and courses on the internet

- Very large and active community

- Interpreted language and high level

LANGUAGE FOR EVERYONE

- It is possible to develop in Python on several OSs (Linux, Windows, Mac, etc.)

- Use in several areas such as: web development, AI / Machine Learning, scripting, data science, computer graphics, etc.

- Many opportunities in the job market
