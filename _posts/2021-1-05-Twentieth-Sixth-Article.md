title: Develop Yourself
---

The last years of my life, I've been thinking about some fundamentals to be able to balance work with quality of life. So, I created a diagram to represent this. I called it: Work-life-projects Balance Diagram.

Basically, the diagram consists of 5 large groups. Each one represents an area in which we should pay attention in order to have a more balanced life.

Follow the diagram and below, an explanation of each area  with some examples.

Healthy & Hobbies: this area represents the investment of your time in your physical and mental health and in doing things you like with people you like. For example: play tennis, spending time with family, read a book.

Culture & Knowledge: invest your time in learning new languages, learning about cultures and discovering things you never imagined knowing. For example: study Deutsch, travel.

Profession & Career: focus on evolving and developing as a professional in the job market you like. For example: study a new programming language, go to IT events.

Income & Finance: plan and structure yourself financially to have a comfortable future. For example: generate passive income, create your emergency reserve.

Side Projects & Entrepreneurship: seek something new and expand your horizons. For example: develop a personal project, open a startup.

I hope that this short text will trigger an internal reflection within each one of us and that we have a 2021 with a lot of work and quality of life!
