title: Linux basic commands
---

Hi folks! I'm an Ubuntu user, and last week (july/2018) I presented a lecture about it for beginners in this operating system.

Here I will not go into the history of Linux and I will not discuss the difference between free software and open source as I did in the presentation.

The purpose of this article is to simply pass on some basic and useful commands to anyone entering in this world.

Follow below commands I usually use:

sudo - SuperUserDo

ls - list directory contents

cd - changing directory

pwd - print working directory

cp - copy a file/dir

mv - move/rename

rm - remove

mkdir - make dir

history - command line history

cat - concatenate files to standard output

grep - search text

 | - redirection

ps - list current process

clear - clear the terminal screen

man - display commands manual

top - display Linux processes

file - determine file type

And what other Linux commands do you usually use daily?
